## üê£ Introduction

I decided to follow an online course provided by coursera to learn new concepts and work on projects.

This mooc is about data science and is divided in 9 course. [Here](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science#courses) you have more info about it. 


In this repository you can find the badges and certifications I got from this course, and all the projects I made related to them.
